Skills: C language, RSA key generation, encryption, decryption, cryptographic libraries, random state modules, GNU multiple precision arithmetic library, data security, algorithm implementation.

## Inference Program                                                                                                                                      		
Developed a program in C using the k-nearest neighbors algorithm to identify likely authors of anonymous text samples, applying stylometry techniques.
Explored applications of stylometry beyond author identification, including composer, artist, and programmer identification. Demonstrated proficiency in data analysis, pattern recognition, and algorithm implementation.

Skills: C language, Algorithm implementation, data structure utilization, command-line interface (CLI), problem-solving, compression statistics analysis, efficient data encoding and decoding.

## Implement A Compression Technique                                                                                             		    
Developed encoder program using Huffman coding algorithm to compress files, achieving efficient data storage.
Developed decoder program to efficiently decompress compressed files, restoring them to their original size.
Implemented priority queue and code table for constructing Huffman tree and generating compressed output files.

Skills: C language, Huffman encoding and decoding, command-line interface (CLI) implementation, compression statistics calculation, data structure utilization (priority queue, code table), file traversal and manipulation, algorithm implementation.
